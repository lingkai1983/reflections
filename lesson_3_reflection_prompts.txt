When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   when I want to collaborate with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    at various point of time, you may not want to adpot the changes from other people

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    branch : only operates on a single repository
	clone :  copy one repository from local to local or github to local
	fork   : copy one repository from github to github

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    people could have a common place to fork with and has a fix point of time to revert back if needed.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    overall github is easy to do collaboration job since everything is tracable.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
